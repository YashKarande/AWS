# A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) defense for consistent and optimal gaming performance in cloud environment
## ABSTRACT
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks target resource availability and performance of online gaming services hosted in cloud environments. These attacks can disrupt gameplay, degrade user experience, and inflict financial losses on gaming providers. To ensure optimal online gaming experience and mitigate the impact of DDoS attacks, there is a need for robust defense mechanisms specifically designed for cloud environments. This research project explores the topic of protecting cloud infrastructure to improve online gaming experience in response to the escalating likelihood of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
In order to maintain gameplay and customer satisfaction, DDoS attacks have become a serious concern for cloud-based gaming systems, demanding the development of advanced defense methods. AWS services are used in the project's methodology to strengthen the gaming infrastructure. Testing scenarios that are precisely thorough are used to evaluate performance. Two different test cases include simulating DDoS attacks with different payload each, and then carefully comparing mean latency before and after the implementation of the WAF. Comprehensive insights into system performance under stress are observed that depict traffic trends, filtering outcomes, and network utilization. The project concludes with findings that offer a useful framework for utilizing AWS services to minimize DDoS threats across various industries as well as improvements to cloud security for online gaming.

### Research Problem
This project focuses on the crucial problem of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in cloud computing settings, especially their effects on cloud gaming services and the best possible gaming experience for players. The potential for DDoS attacks against cloud infrastructure and services poses a serious threat to the availability and integrity of gaming platforms as cloud gaming grows in popularity and transitions to a mainstream form of entertainment. These online attacks, which take advantage of weak nodes, can cause service interruptions, deny access to cloud resources, and cause large financial losses. There is a critical need to create effective defense mechanisms and methods due to the complexity and sophistication of DDoS attacks to achieve DDoS resilience in the cloud and sustain continuous and flawless gaming experiences for gamers everywhere. To improve the security posture of cloud gaming services and promote the long-term expansion of this paradigm-shifting industry, this research aims to explore the complexities of DDoS attacks in the context of cloud gaming, analyze their effects, and propose practical solutions to safeguard cloud-based gaming platforms.

### Aim of the Research
This project aims to comprehend the complexities and effects of DDoS attacks against cloud gaming platforms, to develop efficient defense mechanism and strategies to protect against these threats, and to provide insightful information to strengthen the security posture of cloud-based gaming infrastructure, promoting the sustained growth and sustainability of this paradigm-shifting industry.

### Objective of the Research
+ To analyze the vulnerabilities and threats posed by DDoS attacks on cloud-based infrastructure and services.
  
+	To develop and implement defense mechanisms with the use of AWS services, such as AWS WAF, Elastic Load Balancing, etc. to mitigate the impact of a rate-based (high or low frequency) DDoS attacks on cloud-gaming infrastructure and services.
  
+	To evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented defense mechanism through comprehensive testing scenarios and performance measurements.
  
+	To assess the improvements in network latency and its consistent utilization achieved by the defense mechanism in cloud-based online gaming environments.

### Scope
This project's scope includes using AWS WAF, stress testing, and performance monitoring to combat DDoS attacks in the context of cloud-based online gaming. A major part of the defense system, AWS WAF offers to filter and monitor features to counter typical attack vectors of which we will be simulating a rate-based (high or low) DDOS attack. On compute instances that simulate DDoS attack scenarios, stress tests are run, and performance metrics are captured to determine how resilient the system is under pressure. Performance indicators including response time and network latency are thoroughly tracked throughout the procedure using instance stress test terminal and Amazon CloudWatch.

Combining these factors allows this project to conduct a thorough analysis of the defense mechanism's effectiveness in fending off DDoS attacks while maintaining network quality. The addition of AWS WAF improves the platform's capacity to identify and block malicious traffic, minimizing disruptions for genuine users. Stress testing provides information on how resilient the system is to attacks, allowing for the detection of potential weaknesses and places for development. CloudWatch measurements offer a comprehensive perspective of how the defense mechanism reacts to various assault intensities by providing quantitative data on system performance during stress tests. The research accomplishes this by bridging the gap between cybersecurity and online gaming and by offering a solution that integrates both fields to promote the best possible gaming environment in the face of ongoing DDoS threats.

### Key Factors affecting performance

+	Network Bandwidth: To successfully transmit data and services to customers, a sufficient network bandwidth is essential. Smooth data transfer, rapid responses, and low latency are all made possible by sufficient bandwidth. In order to fulfil customer requests and avoid bottlenecks that might negatively affect performance, cloud providers must constantly analyze and optimize network resources.
  
+	Location: Network latency and user response times are impacted by the physical location of data centers. The majority of customers' proximity to data centers minimizes data transmission times and boosts overall performance. Planning locations strategically guarantees effective data transmission and improved user experiences.
  
+	High availability: To satisfy customer requests, cloud services must be available and functional constantly. Data replication, redundancy, and failover procedures are used to guarantee continued service availability even in the case of hardware failures.
  
+	Rapid scaling: To meet changing customer expectations, cloud services should grow rapidly and effortlessly. When using cloud infrastructure, automatic scaling based on real-time use measurements enables dynamic resource allocation as needed, maintaining peak performance and preventing irrational resource consumption during off-peak hours.
  
+	Number of Users: In order to avoid overtaxing data centers and reducing performance, cloud service companies must carefully monitor the number of users accessing their services. The cloud can support the anticipated number of users without degrading performance thanks to effective capacity planning and resource allocation mechanisms.
  
+	Storage Capacity: To handle the data and applications stored on the cloud, sufficient storage space is required. In order to keep up with expanding data volumes and guarantee flawless data access and retrieval, cloud providers must constantly check and increase storage resources.
  
+	Latency: The time elapsed between a user request and the cloud's answer is referred to as latency. For real-time applications and interactive services, low latency is essential. To reduce latency and enhance user experience, cloud providers must optimize network topologies, data center locations, and data transfer methods.

### Project Design and Architecture
The architecture as shown in the Figure below for game creation that makes use of Amazon Web Services (AWS) components is intended to offer a solid and scalable infrastructure that guarantees the best performance, dependability, and standard security for online gaming experiences. In order to create a fluid and immersive gaming environment, this architecture integrates a number of AWS services and resources. The managed DNS service provided by AWS, Amazon Route 53, is at the center of the architecture. Players' traffic is guided to the proper resources inside the architecture by Route 53. By dynamically routing traffic to the closest AWS resources, it plays a crucial part in maintaining high availability and low latency.

### Project Approach
In our project, we have integrated Amazon Web Services (AWS) Web Application Firewall (WAF) with custom filter rules and WAF management rules to develop a strong defense mechanism against rate-based Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Our game development infrastructure's Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) is notably affected by this integration. The main objective is to protect the gaming environment from obstructive and malicious traffic patterns so that gamers may enjoy seamless and optimal gameplay.

Let's consider for illustration, that a single IP address suddenly starts to send a large number of inbound requests to our online game. This can be a sign of an impending DDoS attempt to take down the gaming servers. We have established specific filter rules within AWS WAF to mitigate this vulnerability. These rules are intended to identify and stop incoming traffic patterns that involve more requests from a single source than a predetermined threshold within a predetermined period of time. The AWS WAF will immediately block further requests from that IP address if the incoming request rate goes beyond this limit, preventing the attack from taking up server resources and interfering with gameplay.

In order to defend against typical attack patterns, we have also used WAF managed rules, which are pre-configured rule sets offered by AWS. For instance, cross-site scripting or SQL injection attacks are often utilized techniques in DDoS attacks. We proactively protect our gaming infrastructure from potential vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit by enabling WAF controlled rules relating to various attack types.

Additionally, we have integrated CloudWatch monitoring to further strengthen our defense approach. In order to track important performance indicators for the ELB and associated instances, such as CPU usage and network packet metrics for further analysis. Consider the case where we notice a sharp rise in CPU usage during a game session together with a surge in incoming network packets. This strange behavior can be a sign of a DDoS attack with a rate-based strategy that targets our gaming environment. CloudWatch captures the metrics in real-time for future improvements in the design. Also, we are able to quickly remedy the situation by banning malicious IP addresses, automatically diverting traffic through the WAF, or scaling up resources to manage the additional loads.

By adopting this comprehensive strategy, we make sure that our online gaming platform is robust to rate-based DDoS attacks by using this all-encompassing defense strategy. We are able to effectively identify, mitigate, and react to possible risks because of the integration of AWS WAF's real-time filtering capabilities, ELB's load balancing and distribution of traffic, and CloudWatch's proactive monitoring. Players can thus experience intense gaming without being disturbed by harmful communications, which ultimately helps to create a more secure and entertaining gaming environment.


### Project Architecture

The proposed research's design and architecture as shown in Figure below strives for stable network performance in a cloud environment and adds a defense layer utilizing AWS WAF to ensure the seamless integration of protective measures while minimizing any adverse effects on gaming quality. While there are many parts to the game development infrastructure design, the compute instances and their connection to a load balancer fortified with AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) are the main areas of our attention.

In this sophisticated architecture, the cloud environment is used to orchestrate the compute instances hosting the gaming application. In order to ensure load distribution and redundancy, an intelligent load balancer is positioned as the gateway to spread incoming traffic among numerous compute instances. The load balancer is connected with AWS WAF and serves as the first line of defense against DDoS attacks. Only valid requests may now reach the compute instances thanks to this integration, which gives the architecture the ability to automatically filter and reject fraudulent traffic.

### Results
#### Test Case 1:
We created a DDoS-like attack on the ELB's DNS address and ran a stress test using the npmjs LoadTest package 20K request from 100 concurrent nodes (BOTs) with 500 rates per second. This gave us the ability to mimic a large surge of traffic that would occur during a real DDoS attack. We recorded the mean latency, time taken, total errors and any possible rise in mistake rates during this test. The objective was to evaluate the ELB's actions under such challenging circumstances and comprehend its functionality with and without WAF protection.
Notice in Figure Test-1 that all the requests are accepted and processed by the system which does not have WAF associated with it.

we can observe after associating WAF to our load balancer, that by enabling the managed rules and custom rate-based rule of WAF, we not only achieve lower latency but also successfully blocked malicious requests affecting the system. Observe the total errors found after applying WAF.

#### Test Case 2:
We repeated the stress test, but this time we changed stress metrics by setting 12K requests from 150 concurrent nodes (BOTs) with 500 rates per second to absolutely make sure that our previously achieved results are true as observed and stated. 

Test-3 – 12K requests 150 nodes 500 RatePerSecond (without WEB-ACL)
