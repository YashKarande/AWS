#DESCRIPTION
The architecture designed for the cafe business on the AWS Cloud incorporates a wide range of services to ensure a scalable, secure, and efficient infrastructure. At its core, a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is implemented to provide isolated networking resources, allowing fine-grained control over network configurations for 2 availability zones, all public and private subnets, Route tables, Internet gateway, Security groups and Network Access Control Lists. Within the VPC, Amazon EC2 instances are deployed to host the cafe's web servers, ensuring reliable and responsive online services. The architecture also includes Elastic File System (EFS), a shared file storage solution, enabling seamless collaboration and data sharing among different components of the cafe's infrastructure, a load balancer and an auto-scaling group spread across both availability zones.

To manage and store critical data, the architecture utilizes Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service), offering a managed database solution for customer orders, inventory, and other business data. IAM (Identity and Access Management) is implemented to enforce granular access controls and user permissions, ensuring the protection of the cafe's infrastructure and data from unauthorized access following list privilege access to all roles and user accounts. ElastiCache is utilized for efficient caching of frequently accessed data, improving overall performance and reducing latency for customer interactions. The SystemsManager Parameter store is leveraged for managing credentials for the cafe's resources.

The architecture incorporates various DevOps tools to enhance development and deployment processes. Cloud9 provides a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) for collaborative coding and debugging. CodeCommit serves as a fully-managed source control service (similar to Git), enabling secure and scalable code collaboration. CodePipeline offers a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) service, automating code releases and streamlining the software delivery process. CloudFormation is utilized for infrastructure as code (IaC), enabling the automated deployment and management of the cafe's AWS resources.

To optimize content delivery and improve website performance, the architecture includes CloudFront, a content delivery network (CDN), which caches and delivers static and dynamic content, such as menus, images, and website assets, with low latency and high availability. Route53, the DNS management service, ensures reliable and seamless access to the cafe's online services, enabling customers to easily reach the website from anywhere in the world.

In addition to the mentioned services, the architecture for the cafe business also incorporates a Warm Standby pattern for Disaster Recovery. This pattern ensures that the infrastructure remains highly available and resilient in the event of a disaster or system failure. The Warm Standby pattern involves setting up redundant resources in a separate geographic region to act as a backup or standby environment. In this architecture, a duplicate set of resources such as VPC, EC2 instances, RDS database, and other necessary components are provisioned in a different AWS region. This standby environment remains synchronized with the primary environment, constantly replicating data and configurations to ensure consistency. To achieve this, data replication mechanisms such as RDS Multi-AZ deployment and/or database replication mechanisms can be utilized. This allows for automatic failover to the standby database instance in case of a primary database failure. Additionally, backups and snapshots of critical data and configurations are taken regularly and stored in a separate region for added data protection. Load balancers such as the Application Load Balancer (ALB) can be configured to distribute traffic between the primary and standby environments. In the event of a failure in the primary environment, traffic can be redirected to the standby environment seamlessly, ensuring minimal disruption to customer access and services.

By combining these resources, the architecture provides a comprehensive and scalable solution for the cafe business, offering secure data storage, efficient resource management, streamlined development processes, and optimized content delivery to enhance the overall customer experience.
